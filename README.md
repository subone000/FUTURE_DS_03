# 🎓 Student Feedback Analysis – Data Insights on Event Satisfaction  

📊 This project analyzes student feedback from multiple university events to uncover **satisfaction drivers, departmental performance, and improvement opportunities**.  

✅ **Why this project matters:**  
It demonstrates real-world **data wrangling, visualization, sentiment analysis, and statistical testing** — exactly the skills expected in analytics & data science roles.  

---

## 🔑 Key Insights  
- 📈 **Overall satisfaction rating:** 4.2 / 5  
- 🏆 **Top events:** AI Hackathon, Music Fest, Gaming Night  
- 🏅 **Best department:** CSE (~4.7/5)  
- ⚠️ **Lowest departments:** IT (~2.0/5), ECE (~2.7/5)  
- 💬 **Sentiment analysis:** Majority positive → negatives highlight *long/boring sessions*  
- 📊 **Statistical tests:**  
  - **ANOVA** → Significant differences across departments (p < 0.05)  
  - **Correlation** → Strong positive relationship between ratings & sentiment (r ≈ 0.65)
